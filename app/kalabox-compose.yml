# Kalabox Drupal compose file
#
# This contains the core service definitions to run Drupal on Kalabox. This
# is a docker-compose file so please check out the compose file documentation
# over at https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/.
#
# There are, however, a few caveats to take into account kalabox-compose.ymls
#
#   1. It is probably a bad idea to use the `container_name` key.
#
#   2. You can run `kbox env` inside of your app for a list of environmental
#      variables that you can use inside of this compose file.
#
#   3. Ports need to be exposed to the host on the outside using
#
#      ports:
#       - "PORTNUMBER"
#
#      Otherwise they are not usable in the services plugin.
#
#    4. The config directory in your app root contains a lot of
#       service config that is shared into each service. This is all
#       editable directly and should take on a `kbox restart`.
#

#
# This defines a data container to share common drupal app assets such as:
#
#   1. /media - Static assets like images and compiled css, Your files/wp-uploads
#               directory is symlinked here
#
#   3. /var/lib/mysql - MariaDB databases to preserve data on rebuilds
#
#   4. /var/www/html - Your applications codebase, also where you shared code lives
#
data:
  image: busybox
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/mysql
    - /var/www/html
    - $KALABOX_APP_ROOT_BIND/files:/media

#
# This defines a basic Drupal appserver.
#
# The $KALABOX_APP_DRUPAL_CONFIG_VERSION var should contain the
# appropriate major version of drupal
